A basic React Native application for cycling through JSON quotes


The quotes.json file contains the pre defined quotes from which the application pulls quotes from. It cycles through the quotes
on pressing a button. 

I have not included the ios folder here as there were some issues targeting the iOS build. The android build works just fine.
The styling is basic and can be obviously improved upon as per requirements. 

A great place to start for React-Native. The basics are are utilised completely and makes clear the basics of navigation, 
constructor and props.

Cheers!
